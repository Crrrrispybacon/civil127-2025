## File structure
The contents for the lab sessions are placed under the folders entitled `Lab_X`, which includes the lab instructions, solutions (as notebooks) and supplimentary materials.
For setting up the environment, please go through the guides in Lab 1 folder, and a trouble-shooting guide for Windows is available [there](./Lab_1_Setup_and_Basics/Windows%20setup%20troubleshooting.md).

The `solutions` folder contains the answers to the exercises as Python files (more concise).
For exercises related to the Sokoban game, the entry point is usually a file named `sokoban.py`.
The script will load a game board from the `levels` folder (now placed in `solutions`), and the default path assumes that the codes will be run from the `solutions` folder.
One can open the `solutions` folder in VS Code and use the "Run and Debug" function.
Alternatively, one can also adjust the path in the codes.
